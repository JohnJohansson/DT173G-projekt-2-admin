Admin page for api projekt

## Admin
This is the Admin part of my three part api projekt. With this you can use the login you created with the 

API install file and login to be able to add new API's delete API's or update API's. Only the Admin can 

accses these funktions. 

You can see the two other parts of my projekt here: https://github.com/JohnJohansson/DT173G-projekt-1

And here: https://github.com/JohnJohansson/DT173G-projekt-3-api

When you try to login you will be sent to a authenticate page, if password and name is correkt you will be 

logged in if not you will be sent back to the login page.

When logedin you will see the admin page with a tabbel with the three apis and thier data.

From these tabbels you can delete or update the data, if you press update you can use the form in the right 

sidbar farthest down to change whatever data you wish and then save.

If you like to add new data to one of the API's use the coresponding form in the right sidbar.
